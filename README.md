# Coffe-sales-project

In this project, I created an Excel file to analyze coffee sales and customer orders. The work involved several steps:

Data Preparation & Cleaning:

Organized raw sales data into structured tables.

Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized product names.

Created calculated columns (e.g., total sales = price Ã— quantity).

Sales & Orders Analysis:

Built pivot tables to summarize sales by product, category, and region.

Tracked daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends.

Identified top-selling coffee products and peak order periods.

Visualization & Dashboard:

Used charts (bar, line, and pie) to visualize sales performance.

Designed an interactive dashboard to monitor sales, revenue, and order distribution.

Highlighted KPIs such as total revenue, number of orders, and average order value.

Insights & Results:

Discovered which coffee types generated the highest revenue.

Identified seasonal patterns and peak times for sales.

Provided actionable insights to support business decisions.
